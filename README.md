### Hi, I'm Erik 👋🏼 

I'm a researcher at the [Jožef Stefan Institute][job] who is interested in all manner of Artificial Intelligence with a focus on Natural Language Processing, e.g. cross-lingual language models, as well as (semi-)automatic text processing and visualization. I'm passionate in developing machine learning models and software that can be used for various tasks and in both scientific and business domains.
